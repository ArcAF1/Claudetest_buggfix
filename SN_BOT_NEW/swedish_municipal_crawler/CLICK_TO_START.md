## 🛑 How to Stop

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal window to stop all services.

## 🔧 If You Still Have Issues

### Option 1: Run the Dependency Installer First
```bash
python3 install_dependencies.py
```
This will install all required packages and verify they work.

### Option 2: Manual Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install aiohttp asyncio-throttle nest-asyncio
```

### Option 3: Direct Command Line
```bash
python3 start_phase1_system.py --quick-start
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If the .command file doesn't work:
1. **Right-click** the file → **Open With** → **Terminal**
2. Or run manually: `bash START_PHASE1.command`

### If dependencies fail:
1. Run: `python3 install_dependencies.py`
2. Then try the .command file again

### If you see "permission denied":
```bash
chmod +x START_PHASE1.command
```
