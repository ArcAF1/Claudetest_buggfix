    "area_based": true,
    "pbb_based": false,
    "area_range": {"type": "threshold", "value": 120}
}
```

### Enhanced Statistics

The crawler now tracks detailed extraction statistics:

```json
{
    "extraction_stats": {
        "sitevision": {
            "pages": 45,
            "fees": 234,
            "js_used": 12
        },
        "municipio": {
            "pages": 38,
            "fees": 189,
            "ajax_used": 8
        },
        "generic": {
            "pages": 67,
            "fees": 156,
            "strategies_used": 23
        },
        "pdf": {
            "processed": 89,
            "fees": 445
        },
        "bygglov": {
            "processed": 34,
            "fees": 178
        }
    },
    "validation_stats": {
        "total_processed": 1202,
        "total_valid": 1089,
        "confidence_distribution": {
            "high": 756,
            "medium": 333,
            "low": 113
        }
    }
}
```

## Resume Capability

The crawler supports resuming interrupted crawls:

```bash
# Resume previous crawl
python run_crawler.py --resume
```

Resume data is stored in `crawls/swedish_municipalities/` and includes:
- Request queue state
- Duplicate filter state
- Spider statistics
- **PDF cache state**

## Update Detection

Use the `update_checker.py` helper to find municipalities that may have
changed their fee information since the last crawl. This allows targeted
recrawling so the dataset stays fresh.

```bash
python crawler/utils/update_checker.py --db data/output/phase1_municipal_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.db
```

The script sends lightweight HTTP `HEAD` requests to the previously collected
source URLs and lists the pages where a newer `Last-Modified` timestamp is
observed.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Levels

- `DEBUG`: Detailed debugging information including PDF extraction details
- `INFO`: General information (default)
- `WARNING`: Warning messages
- `ERROR`: Error messages only

### Statistics

The crawler tracks:
- Total fees extracted
- Municipalities processed
- Success/failure rates
- CMS type distribution
- Category breakdown
- Validation statistics
- **PDF extraction statistics**
- **Bygglov-specific metrics**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Extraction Failures**:
   ```bash
   # Test PDF dependencies
   python -c "import camelot, pdfplumber, cv2; print('All PDF dependencies OK')"
   
   # Check Ghostscript installation
   gs --version
   ```

2. **Camelot Issues**:
   - Ensure Ghostscript is installed and in PATH
   - Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
   - For Linux: Install `libgl1-mesa-glx`

3. **Memory Issues with Large PDFs**:
   - PDFs over 10MB are automatically skipped
   - Increase system memory or reduce concurrent processing

4. **Swedish Character Encoding**:
   - Ensure UTF-8 encoding in all text processing
   - Check locale settings: `locale`

### Debug Mode

Run with debug logging to troubleshoot PDF extraction:
```bash
python run_crawler.py --log-level DEBUG
```

This will show detailed information about:
- PDF download and caching
- Table detection results
- Extraction method selection
- Pattern matching details

## Performance Optimization

### Recommended Settings

For large-scale crawling:
- Enable Redis caching for URL prioritization
- Use PDF caching to avoid re-downloads
- Monitor system resources during PDF processing
- Use resume capability for long crawls

### PDF Processing Optimization

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple PDFs processed concurrently
- **Smart Caching**: PDFs cached by content hash

The enhanced extractors provide detailed logging:

```bash
# Enable detailed extraction logging
python run_crawler.py --log-level DEBUG

# This shows:
# - CMS detection results
# - JavaScript extraction attempts
# - AJAX endpoint discoveries
# - Validation rule applications
# - Confidence score calculations
# - Quality indicator assessments
```

### Quality Metrics

Monitor extraction quality with built-in metrics:

- **Extraction Efficiency**: Fees per page by CMS type
- **Confidence Distribution**: High/medium/low confidence breakdown
- **Validation Success Rate**: Percentage of fees passing validation
- **Method Effectiveness**: Success rates by extraction method
- **JavaScript Usage**: When and how often JS extraction is used

## üÜï Troubleshooting Enhanced Features

### JavaScript Extraction Issues

1. **Playwright Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure Playwright is properly installed
   playwright install chromium
   
   # Test Playwright
   python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; print('Playwright OK')"
   ```

2. **JavaScript Timeout Issues**:
   - Increase timeout in settings: `PLAYWRIGHT_DEFAULT_NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT`
   - Check network connectivity
   - Monitor memory usage during extraction

### Validation Issues

1. **Low Confidence Scores**:
   - Check Swedish content patterns
   - Verify fee amount ranges
   - Review extraction method effectiveness

2. **High Validation Failure Rate**:
   - Adjust validation thresholds
   - Review Swedish-specific patterns
   - Check source URL validation rules

### Performance Optimization

1. **JavaScript Extraction**:
   - Use selectively based on CMS detection
   - Cache JavaScript results
   - Monitor browser resource usage

2. **Validation Pipeline**:
   - Adjust validation rule weights
   - Optimize Swedish pattern matching
   - Use confidence thresholds to filter low-quality data

## üÜï Advanced Usage

### Enhanced Extraction with JavaScript

```bash
# Run with enhanced JavaScript extraction
python run_crawler.py --enable-js --log-level DEBUG

# Test specific extractor
python test_enhanced_extractors.py
```

### Validation Configuration

The validation pipeline can be configured through settings:

```python
# In settings.py
ENHANCED_VALIDATION_SETTINGS = {
    'confidence_threshold': 0.6,
    'strict_swedish_validation': True,
    'enable_quality_scoring': True,
    'validation_rules': {
        'amount_validation': {
            'min_amount': 50,
            'max_amount': 100000
        }
    }
}
```
